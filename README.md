# TEST ASSIGNMENT
It's not a secret that some of us in Qminder are often craving for burgers. We are willing to walk for kilometers to have our favourite burger. We want to be the first ones in the town to have a burger when a new venue pops up.

Your task is to help us with that mission. Create site which shows all burger joints in Tartu on a map and their latest picture.

### DESIGN
We have created mockups for [web](http://careers.qminder.com/frontend-ninja-assignment/mock-web.png) and [iPhone](http://careers.qminder.com/frontend-ninja-assignment/mock-iphone.png).

Follow the design of the mockups and make sure your implementation is responsive.

### DATA
Use Foursquare API to fetch venues.

### MAP
Use Google Maps for the map.

Show all burger joints on the map except the ones in a 1km radius from the Tartu bus station.

Clicking on a venue should show its name.

Draw a 1km circle around bus station where venues are not displayed.

### PHOTOS
Show latest picture in the venue.
